  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Launched January 1, 2016 for the 2016 Spring Track Season.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this site is to disseminate the results (times) to coaches, fans, parents, athletes and
      everyone faster. Typically, results must be completely gathered by the meet management software, then
      printed, then posted, then athletes or coaches must search through printed pages for times. We want to
      get results to interested parties as soon as they are available. Scoreboard and other display systems
      are expensive, in the thousands of dollars for small display, and partial millions of dollars for large
      scoreboard displays, and only show the information for a short term.</p>
    <p>Therefore, as soon as the times are saved, we grab that file and process the information and push the
      information out to anyone who has the the meet page loaded. <em>You don't even need to refresh your
      browser to get the results!</em></p>
    <p>While the exact availability of the results is impossible to predict, since it depends upon the timer
      operator, once the file is saved, it takes less than 1 second before you have the results in your
      browser on your phone or tablet or computer. Results are pushed automaticalls. No refreshing the browser
      page needed &mdash; that will actually be slower.</p>
    <p>HEY! WHAT ABOUT FIELD EVENTS?!?! When I developed the site, I only had access to FinishLynx .LIF files.
      If you have FieldLynx .LIF files to share so I can develop this, I would love to do so.
      Please {!! link_to('/contact', 'contact') !!} me.</p>
    <p>HEY! WHAT ABOUT NON LYNX!? I plan to expand to cover all systems. If you have access to the datafiles
      that a timing system (or field system) outputs, please <%= link_to 'contact', contact_path, class: 'link' %>
      me.</p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Michael Hoppes</strong> &mdash; Owner & Creator &mdash; I started timing high school track
        meets in 2008 using FinishLynx. Since I sat in the timing tent, I often got asked "Hey, can I get
        the time for athlete / lane / school?" Instead of helping one coach or athlete, I figured everyone would
        want to have the data sooner. It's a scoreboard in your hand.
      </li>
      <li><strong>You?</strong> &mdash; ? &mdash; Want to help? Contact me. Mostly spreading the word and
        retro-data-validation is needed. Using it at your meet would be awesome.
      </li>
